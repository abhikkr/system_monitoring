# system_monitoring

This is a project which shows the cpu usage, ram usage and the space left in current dir in a dashboard.

Run the dashboard.py to start the project.

One can use the gui but the gui needs improvement.

I am not currently focusing on the styling part.Just to understand the engineering part of gui making.
